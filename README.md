# Tech-Blog

  ## Description

  This project was created because I wanted to create a tech blog for people to talk about coding.
  What this does is it uses a mysql server and handlebars to create a page where a user can make posts abd other users can comment.
  What I learned from project was how to make sessions and authentications for certain parts of the pages, how to use handlebars to load different pages and how to route said pages.
